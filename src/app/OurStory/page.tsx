      "History has it; In the 9th century a local herdsman named Kaldi saw one of his goats acting anomaly after eating the berries of a certain shrub. Kaldi then complained to the local Abbot of a monastery about the frolicsome behaviour of his goat. This then started being practiced in the monastery which grew into the community and finally went on globally. This chain, tower of dreamers, of achievement is what Tomoca is based on. The passion of dreamers to disrupt the status quo the same way that anomaly goat did, is shared with Tomoca.",
